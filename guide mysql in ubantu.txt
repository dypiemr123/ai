To access MySQL on Ubuntu, follow these steps:

1. **Install MySQL (if not installed)**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install mysql-server
   ```

2. **Start the MySQL Service** (if it isn’t already running):
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start mysql
   ```

3. **Secure MySQL Installation** (optional but recommended):
   Run the following command to set up security options, such as setting a root password and removing test databases:
   ```bash
   sudo mysql_secure_installation
   ```

4. **Log in to MySQL**:
   Use the following command to log in as the root user:
   ```bash
   sudo mysql -u root -p
   ```
   After entering the above command, you will be prompted to enter the MySQL root password.

5. **Access MySQL Prompt**:
   If your login is successful, you’ll see the MySQL prompt:
   ```sql
   mysql>
   ```
   From here, you can run SQL queries and manage your databases.

6. **Exit MySQL**:
   To exit the MySQL prompt, type:
   ```sql
   exit;
   ```

This setup provides full access to MySQL on Ubuntu, allowing you to manage databases and users effectively.
